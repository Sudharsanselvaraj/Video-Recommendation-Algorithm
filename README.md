Video Recommendation Algorithm Documentation
1. Introduction
The Video Recommendation Algorithm is designed to provide personalized video suggestions to users based on their interaction history. This system uses content-based filtering techniques to recommend videos similar to those a user has already interacted with (liked, watched, etc.).

Objectives:
Recommend personalized videos to users based on their preferences and interactions.
Handle cold-start problems for new users or new videos.
Evaluate recommendation performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
2. System Overview
This recommendation algorithm employs a content-based filtering approach, which utilizes video metadata (e.g., category, view-to-like ratio) and user interaction data (e.g., user ID, video ID) to compute similarity between videos.

Key components of the system:

Data Loading: Fetches data about videos and user interactions.
Preprocessing: Cleans and transforms the data, such as encoding categories and normalizing numerical features.
Cosine Similarity Calculation: Measures how similar two videos are using cosine similarity.
Recommendation Generation: Based on similarity scores, recommends the most relevant videos to users.
Evaluation: Measures the effectiveness of the recommendations with RMSE and MAE.

To run this project locally, follow these installation instructions:

Requirements:
Python 3.7 or higher
pip (Python package manager)
Steps:
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/video-recommendation.git
cd video-recommendation
Set Up Virtual Environment (Optional):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare Data: Make sure you have the user_interactions.csv and video_metadata.csv files in the /data folder.

4. Data Sources
User Interaction Data:
This dataset contains information about which users have interacted with which videos. It includes:

User ID: Identifier for each user.
Video ID: Identifier for each video.
Interaction Type: Type of user interaction (e.g., like, view, etc.).
Example:

user_id	video_id	interaction_type
1	101	like
2	102	view
1	103	view
Video Metadata:
This dataset contains attributes about each video, such as:

Video ID: Identifier for each video.
Category: Genre or category of the video (e.g., comedy, documentary, music).
View-Like Ratio: The ratio of views to likes, representing the video's popularity.
Example:

video_id	category	view_like_ratio	title
101	comedy	3.5	Funny Cat Video
102	documentary	4.2	Nature's Wonders
103	music	5.1	Top 40 Music Hits
5. Preprocessing
The preprocessing stage cleans and transforms raw data to make it suitable for the recommendation algorithm. This typically includes:

Handling Missing Data: Removing or filling missing values in both interaction and video metadata datasets.
Encoding Categorical Data: Converting the video category to numeric values using encoding techniques like Label Encoding.
Scaling Numerical Data: Normalizing or scaling numerical features like view_like_ratio to ensure they are on the same scale.
6. Recommendation Algorithm
The recommendation logic involves the following steps:

6.1 Feature Matrix Creation
We create a feature matrix using two key attributes of videos: view_like_ratio and category. The category is encoded numerically to facilitate similarity computation.
6.2 Cosine Similarity
The core of the recommendation system is calculating cosine similarity between the videos. This measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors representing videos. The smaller the angle, the more similar the videos are.
6.3 Generating Recommendations
For each video the user has interacted with, we compute similarity scores against all other videos. Based on these scores, the top N most similar videos are recommended.
Exclusions: Videos that the user has already interacted with are excluded from the recommendation list.
Threshold: A similarity threshold is applied to ensure that only videos with sufficient similarity are recommended.
7. Handling Cold-Start Problems
A cold-start problem occurs when there is insufficient data for a new user or new video. In this case, the algorithm can:

New User: Recommend popular videos or videos based on general trends.
New Video: Suggest the video based on its category or metadata similarities with previously popular videos.
8. Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the recommendation system is evaluated using the following metrics:

8.1 RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

9. Usage
To run the video recommendation system:

Prepare Your Data: Ensure that your user_interactions.csv and video_metadata.csv files are correctly placed in the /data folder.
Preprocess the Data: Call the preprocessing function to clean and prepare your data.
Generate Recommendations: Run the recommendation function by specifying the user interaction data and video metadata.
python
Copy code
recommended_videos = recommend(user_interaction_data, video_data)
10. Future Work & Enhancements
