Video Recommendation Algorithm
Overview
This project aims to build a video recommendation system capable of suggesting personalized videos to users based on their interactions and preferences. The system utilizes a content-based filtering approach to recommend videos that are similar to those the user has already interacted with, leveraging metadata (such as view-to-like ratio, category, etc.) and user interaction data.

Key Features:
Personalized video recommendations based on user interaction history.
Use of cosine similarity to measure the similarity between videos.
Optional hybrid model support (combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering).
Evaluation of recommendation performance with metrics like MAE and RMSE.
Flexibility to handle cold-start problems, ensuring quality recommendations even for new users or items.

Installation Instructions
To run this project, follow the steps below:

Prerequisites
You need to have the following installed:

Python 3.7 or higher
pip (Python package installer)
Setup Steps
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/video-recommendation.git
cd video-recommendation
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download datasets: You can either use the provided sample datasets or upload your own. The datasets should include user interaction data and video metadata.

Run the algorithm: After installing the dependencies and setting up the datasets, you can run the recommendation script by executing the following command:

bash
Copy code
python main.py

Key Files:
main.py: This is the entry point for the video recommendation system. It orchestrates the workflow of loading data, preprocessing, and generating recommendations.
recommendation_model.py: This contains the core logic of the recommendation algorithm. It defines how recommendations are generated using content-based or collaborative filtering techniques.
utils/preprocessing.py: Contains functions to preprocess the data, such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
utils/evaluation.py: Includes functions for evaluating the model’s performance using metrics like MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
Data Sources
User Interaction Data: This dataset contains information on user interactions with the videos, such as user ID, video ID, and the type of interaction (e.g., like, view).
Video Metadata: This dataset contains information about each video, such as its category, view-to-like ratio, and other relevant attributes.
Example format of user_interactions.csv:

user_id	video_id	interaction_type
1	101	like
2	102	view
1	103	view
Example format of video_metadata.csv:

video_id	category	view_like_ratio	title
101	comedy	3.5	Funny Cat Video
102	documentary	4.2	Nature's Wonders
103	music	5.1	Top 40 Music Hits
Usage
Step 1: Load Data
The system loads user interaction data and video metadata from CSV files.

python
Copy code
user_interaction_data = pd.read_csv('data/user_interactions.csv')
video_data = pd.read_csv('data/video_metadata.csv')
Step 2: Preprocess Data
The preprocess_data() function handles missing values, encodes categories, and scales numerical data.

python
Copy code
user_interaction_data, video_data = preprocess_data(user_interaction_data, video_data)
Step 3: Generate Recommendations
The recommendation system uses cosine similarity to compare videos based on metadata and suggest the most similar videos. You can specify the number of recommendations you need.

python
Copy code
recommended_posts = recommend(user_interaction_data, video_data)
print("Recommended Posts:", recommended_posts)
Step 4: Evaluate the Model (optional)
Evaluate the quality of recommendations using metrics like MAE and RMSE.

python
Copy code
from utils.evaluation import calculate_rmse, calculate_mae

rmse = calculate_rmse(user_interaction_data, recommended_posts)
mae = calculate_mae(user_interaction_data, recommended_posts)

print(f"RMSE: {rmse}")
print(f"MAE: {mae}")
Recommendation System Logic
Content-Based Filtering:
In this approach, we use the metadata of videos, such as the view-to-like ratio and category (encoded numerically), to measure similarity between videos. We use cosine similarity to determine how similar two videos are based on these features.

The core logic involves:

Encoding categorical features.
Calculating a feature matrix based on view-to-like ratio and category.
Computing the cosine similarity between each video.
Recommending videos that are most similar to the ones the user has interacted with.
Cold-Start Problem:
For new users or videos that lack sufficient interaction data, we handle recommendations by using content-based techniques or randomly suggesting popular videos.

Evaluation Metrics
The model is evaluated using:

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Measures the difference between predicted ratings and actual ratings.
MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Measures the average absolute difference between predicted ratings and actual ratings.
You can adjust these metrics based on your specific use case.
